# Test Fixing

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-bundle-qa-testing/skills/test-fixing` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Test Fixing Systematically identify and fix all failing tests using smart grouping strategies.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Systematic Approach, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Explicitly asks to fix tests ("fix these tests", "make tests pass")
- Reports test failures ("tests are failing", "test suite is broken")
- Completes implementation and wants tests passing
- Mentions CI/CD failures due to tests
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Systematically identify and fix all failing tests using smart grouping strategies. Use when explicitly asks to fix tests (\"fix these tests\", \"make tests pass\"), reports test failures (\"tests are failing\", \"test....
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Run make test → 15 failures identified
2. Group errors:
3. 8 ImportErrors (module renamed)
4. 5 AttributeErrors (function signature changed)
5. 2 AssertionErrors (logic bugs)
6. Fix ImportErrors first → Run subset → Verify
7. Fix AttributeErrors → Run subset → Verify

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Example Workflow

User: "The tests are failing after my refactor"

1. Run `make test` → 15 failures identified
2. Group errors:
   - 8 ImportErrors (module renamed)
   - 5 AttributeErrors (function signature changed)
   - 2 AssertionErrors (logic bugs)
3. Fix ImportErrors first → Run subset → Verify
4. Fix AttributeErrors → Run subset → Verify
5. Fix AssertionErrors → Run subset → Verify
6. Run full suite → All pass ✓

#### Imported: Systematic Approach

### 1. Initial Test Run

Run `make test` to identify all failing tests.

Analyze output for:

- Total number of failures
- Error types and patterns
- Affected modules/files

### 2. Smart Error Grouping

Group similar failures by:

- **Error type**: ImportError, AttributeError, AssertionError, etc.
- **Module/file**: Same file causing multiple test failure
- **Root cause**: Missing dependencies, API changes, refactoring impacts

Prioritize groups by:

- Number of affected tests (highest impact first)
- Dependency order (fix infrastructure before functionality)

### 3. Systematic Fixing Process

For each group (starting with highest impact):

1. **Identify root cause**

   - Read relevant code
   - Check recent changes with `git diff`
   - Understand the error pattern

2. **Implement fix**

   - Use Edit tool for code changes
   - Follow project conventions (see CLAUDE.md)
   - Make minimal, focused changes

3. **Verify fix**

   - Run subset of tests for this group
   - Use pytest markers or file patterns:
     ```bash
     uv run pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py -v
     uv run pytest -k "pattern" -v
     ```
   - Ensure group passes before moving on

4. **Move to next group**

### 4. Fix Order Strategy

**Infrastructure first:**

- Import errors
- Missing dependencies
- Configuration issues

**Then API changes:**

- Function signature changes
- Module reorganization
- Renamed variables/functions

**Finally, logic issues:**

- Assertion failures
- Business logic bugs
- Edge case handling

### 5. Final Verification

After all groups fixed:

- Run complete test suite: `make test`
- Verify no regressions
- Check test coverage remains intact

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @test-fixing-v3 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @test-fixing-v3 against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @test-fixing-v3 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @test-fixing-v3 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Fix one group at a time
- Run focused tests after each fix
- Use git diff to understand recent changes
- Look for patterns in failures
- Don't move to next group until current passes
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-bundle-qa-testing/skills/test-fixing`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |



### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
